Beeper: Please call MINIFACT REF: NOTE immediately, Constable.

Call:

This is a priority alert for all active agents. Constable String has recovered a set of documents and maps from a known Renegade Justice hideout. It seems that a rogue cel is preparing to attack miniFACT HQ with an electro-ram. They are hoping to take advantage of the confusion surrounding the bomb to inflict a savage blow on the authority of miniFACT. This must be averted

-- just give me the facts (NO MENTION OF CHEESE)
If the attack goes ahead, this would cause substantial disruption to our operations and Requisition Points would need to be diverted away from all agents to ensure miniFACT doesn&#39;t lose control. If you can find the location of the rogue Renegade Justice cel before they trigger their attack, the crisis will be averted


-- how worried should we be?
It is unlikely that such an attack would in itself destroy miniFACT. A strategic reserve of soldiers are garissoned in the sub-structure of the pyramid should be able to prevent any substantial damage by an armed mob. However, we would have to divert substantial resources from Operations in order to overcome this difficulty. In addition, it might embolden other groups intent on commiting such terrorist acts

-- what&#39;s an electro-ram?
It is an archaic single-use weapon capable of delivering a considerable mechanical impact into a small area, causing a considerable explosion. Traditionally, an electro-ram is used to breach a wall or other such blockade. Although expensive to produce, it is not beyond the capability of a group like Renegade Justice. It resembles a commercial oven

-- is there anything else?
The penmanship of the recovered was questionable, but included an accurate drawing of the circuitry of an electro-ram, leading us to believe that it was drawn in the presence of the object itself. The diagrams were smeared with an oilY substance that we were unable to identify. One technician remarked that it smelled vaguely of cheese. It was folded up tightly and compressed, as if it had been concealed in someone&#39;s boot. </tw-passagedata>
