HAS NETWORK ACCESS, CAN GET SOME INFO BUT HE&#39;LL DEFINITELY DIE

IF YOU CONVINCE HIM, YOU GET IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO CRYPTICJANE

THE DECISION IS BASICALLY INFORMATION NOW AND DEATH, OR LENGTHY DECRPYTION PROCESS LASTING EIGHT HOURS

The information could only come from me. And they’ll know I blabbed, so I’ll die
