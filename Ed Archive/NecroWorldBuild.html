We make about 15 stories.
We randomise how many gods are in a story (sometimes 1, sometimes 2, sometimes... 3?).
We grab the appropriate number.
We look at their relationship - god/demon, god/god, demon/demon, whether they&#39;re opposed, etc (maybe swapping them out if necessary).
We generate a myth for each, ensuring each possibility is covered, using the strings generated in a deck-arrangement.

-- 1 God:
how that god was born
if they are in the ascendant, a story about how they found their domain
if they are in the supressed domains, a story about how they factor into the apocalypse


-- 2 Gods:
if they contain opposites, it&#39;s a story of how one destroyed the other and reshaped the world

if they contain harmonious elements and are in the ascendant, they create a hero, who is surrounded by a sympathetic cult

if they contain harmonious elements and are in the supressed domains, they create a usurper, who is entombed in the dungeon, and what the dungeon actually is

if they have one harmonious element and one discordant element, it&#39;s a story of an uneasy compromise

-- creation story:
something about the ur-god

-- destruction story:
something about how the suppressed gods rise again
something about the dungeon itself
