</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Opening" tags="" position="625,33">You are standing alone in a desert. Orange sand all around, yellow where it catches the light. You are unbearably thirsty. Ahead of you is a sand dune.

[[Climb the dune]]
[[Look backwards]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Climb the dune" tags="" position="598,327">From the top of the dune you see a huge circular white facility, like an upturned thumbtack with a flat-topped tower in the centre. Some areas of the facility are open, and in others are clusters of buildings connected to one another with corridors and tubes. A sand-covered road leads towards a large pair of doors, which are open. A half-full carpark has been mostly consumed by sand. 

Dialogue box:

You came here...

[[to find out what happened here.|next]]
[[because you are stranded, and there is nowhere else to go.|next]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Look backwards" tags="" position="775,165">Your footprints backpedal to the horizon.

[[Climb the dune]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="next" tags="" position="598,477">Your thirst is becoming unbearable.

[[Approach the facility]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Approach the facility" tags="" position="598,627">The doors seem to be the only entrance.

You step into a large lobby area. There is a long reception desk and an array of chairs and tables. Behind the reception the word &#x27;Facade&#x27; is embossed in large letters. The floors and walls are white. The chairs are blue. A large set of closed doors on the far wall seem to lead into the facility proper. A flight of stairs lead up to a mezzanine. A line of small blue lights set into the floor lead from the doors to the top of the stairs.

There is nobody here.

You drink a can of procedurally-generated soda to deal with your thirst.

A voice comes out of nowhere. Male, bubbly, American accent.

&quot;Welcome to Facade Corporate HQ! This is the voice of the Automated Visitor Interface. I am here to ensure that your visit to Facade goes smoothly, and that you know everything you want to know about our operation out here in the Mojave. If you&#x27;re here to take our public tour, please follow the blue floorlights to the mezzanine for our Visitor Experience. If you are a corporate client or here for an arranged meeting with a member of staff, please introduce yourself at the reception desk. If you have any problems, please speak to any one of our company representatives.&quot;

[[Check out the big doors]]
[[Go upstairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Check out the big doors" tags="" position="598,777">The doors won&#x27;t budge. They seem pretty sturdy. The only way is up those stairs.

[[Go upstairs]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Go upstairs" tags="" position="909,629">A narrow mezzanine. There is another small waiting area and a door with a pair of curtains hung around it. 

The voice chimes in again.

&quot;This is the waiting area for the Facade Visitor Experience. A company representative will be along shortly to take you into the Experience, where you will learn about the history of Facade, and see many of the technological discoveries that have secured our status as the largest manufacturer of robotics and nanorobotics in the world. Caution: There will be portions of this tour in which you will be in the same room as operational nanobots. Please refrain from touching or inhaling them, as this can cause serious internal bleeding. If you do inhale nanobots, please seek immediate assistance from your company representative.&quot;

[[Enter the Experience]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Enter the Experience" tags="" position="1026,793">A glass-enclosed catwalk leads out over the facility and enters the side of a glassy building. Below the catwalk is a long room, churchlike, full of trees arranged in rows. There are waterfalls and rivers and ivy and all this green and blue stuff. The trees are young but they look healthy.

&quot;Welcome to the Facade Visitor Experience. Below us, ladies and gentlemen, is the Hall of Trees. Yes, you heard right. These are real, living trees, carefully hybridised and grown right here, in our delicately regulated and purified atmosphere, right in the heart of the USA. Flash photography is permitted in this room only.&quot;

The catwalk leads through another outside area and into a large white structure with chimneys. From here, you can see a factory floor with machines and conveyor belts and things.

&quot;This thriving scene is one of several production centres on the site. Here, we design, prototype and manufacture our signiture lines of utility and security robots. In the alcove on the left (spotlight comes on in empty alcove) you can see one of our famous Small Arms Combat Droids. This particular model is actually the very first robot ever to come off the production line - serial number 0001.&quot;

Catwalk leads to another building, all full of office gear and cubicles, whiteboards and round tables. Before the voice starts, there is a sound of a woman humming. A swarm of nanos potters about down there.

&quot;This building is one our many R&amp;D labs. The staff are encouraged to work on whatever takes their fancy. Some current projects under development are (the voice goes silent for a few moments). As you can see, there&#x27;s rarely a dull moment.&quot;

[[To the demonstration room]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="To the demonstration room" tags="" position="930,939">This is a round room somewhat like a planitareum, with chairs arranged in a circle around an open area.

&quot;Please take a seat. Your Facade Company Representative will now give you a demonstration of our pride and joy - the piece of technology that has made so much innovation possible - Nanobots.&quot;

A swarm of nanobots comes into the room and starts footling around. There are some blocks and things and it starts messing with them.

&quot;The company representative will now demonstrate some of the functions of these remarkable robots. Once the demonstration is over, the tour will continue.&quot;

Pillar emerges from floor with NanoTool on it. Nothing happens until you pick the tool up, at which point some kind of tutorial plays out with dialogue boxes explaining how to use the tool. The door out of the room won&#x27;t open (because the Tool hasn&#x27;t been replaced on its cradle) but you figure a way out.

[[Puzzle your way out.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Puzzle your way out." tags="" position="629,946">The player is back in the main lobby. Next to the exit and at the top of the stairs back to the lobby are little racks with small devices in them.

&quot;That concludes the tour. Please answer a short questionairre before you leave by taking a device from the rack at the top of the stairs and inputting your answers. The gift shop is located on the ground floor.&quot;

After taking a device, the voice seems to come from it:

&quot;Thank you for visiting Facade today. We hope your experience was satisfactory. Question 1: Did you find the tour enjoyable and informative?&quot;

[[Yes|Response 1]]
[[No|Response 1]]
[[I don&#x27;t know|Response 1]]




*Need to get more flava into the voiceovers. Developing a good voice that doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s spouting C21 corporate jargon is a big job.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Response 1" tags="" position="626,1114">As a response is chosen, the questionairre prattles on:

&quot;Thank you. Question two: Has your perception of Facade changed as a consequence of the tour?&quot;

But as this is being read, a female voice goes &quot;Huh?&quot; over the intercom.

[[Yes|Response 2]]
[[No|Response 2]]
[[I don&#x27;t know|Response 2]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Response 2" tags="" position="626,1264">&quot;Question 3. Have you ever visited the Facade Corporate HQ before?&quot;

But over the intercom, someone says

&quot;Hello? Is someone there?&quot; 

If you don&#x27;t respond, the voice carries on saying &quot;Hellooooo?&quot;

[[Yes|y1]]
[[No|n1]]
[[I don&#x27;t know|n1]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="y1" tags="" position="626,1414">Questionairre continues.

Voice says &quot;Yes! Someone is there. I knew it. Hang on, whoever you are! I&#x27;m just going to override the AI.&quot;

Questionairre stops mid-question.

&quot;There. That should keep it quiet for a little while. Now, uh. Gosh. There&#x27;s someone here. And they can hear me. Uh... Greetings, person. Who... Who are you?&quot;

[[Yes|y2]]
[[No|y2]]

But maybe there&#x27;s something I can do with your device... There! Ok. Those devices all have cameras built in as standard.
