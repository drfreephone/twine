-- Add a situation where you must evade the Pit Crew
-- Apply nice CSS to conversation system

-- Threads to develop: Pit crew, strange symbols, whispering keepers, woman on the roof, locket, burial sites

-- some option to remove clothing (eg to uncover face)
-- concept of Filth, which should be attached to clothing rather than to the player generally. Think how this interacts with the 
-- Conversation system needs the following: options for silence or threatening behvaiour
-- some more procedural stuff for use in conversations (the hag will be the first place to really explore this I reckon)
-- explore concept of &#39;bring knowledge up to a certain point&#39; passages for (display)ing when new information is gained and there are various cases for what needs bringing to what point

-- ways to escape cell: wait for transferral to the Pit, use broken glass to cut bonds, persuade jailer using Ledger conversation, or else perhaps using knowledge of the Whispering Keepers?

- consider possible variations on ending: Reach the Depths either via the Pit (by escaping the slavers/making them dig in the right place) or via the Comb (by overcoming the monster that lives there). Also, you should be able to simply escape from the skull through some other means, either contacting the Whispering Keepers or via the roof somehow. However, before you can leave either of those ways you should have to encounter the FACT of the ledger and its unbelievable power, and learn something that makes you think that YOU might be able to access it (that isn&#39;t just the fact that you&#39;re the protagonist of the game). Perhaps your ability to read differentiates you, and you could use the library?



- Traveller&#39;s Friend -&gt; her real role? Involves luring people to the skull, bamboozling them into making the wrongheaded decision to enter? She&#39;s definitely not aligned to any of the agents at work within the skull, however. Her role might be to disrupt whatever&#39;s happening in there. Perhaps her story contains some personal tragedy. Perhaps she is very ancient indeed.



-some characters might refuse to talk to you about certain topics until criteria are met. For example, someone might need bribing with items or some such thing. This is easy to do - just add extra elements to their conversation database when appropritate, and remove these same things from their &#39;list of things asked already&#39; array to allow those topics to be revisited.

Light glints off something moving along a cloister. The temple&#39;s cathedral-deep eye sockets stare, blind and hollow, across the desert. A lick of smoke emerges from somewhere behind the dome of the skull and curls into the sky.

<tw-passagedata pid="34" name="Intro11" tags="" position="468,2207">The ceiling of the shelter is a rotten board, wedged into ragged cracks the stonework. The space is larger than it seemed from outside. The walls in the shelter are tacked with talismans of bone and hair, and something large and rotten is bundled up in the crook of the corner. There is a patterned mat of reeds spread across the floor. On the far wall, glistening, is a series of angular markings that depict a fleshy tongue, impaled on a series of long triangles. 

You gaze at it, transfixed.

Note - to keep the code here from firing (and messing up the actual game, possibly) I&#39;m nesting it in little `` markers that basically neuter it and stop it from having magic code power.

//Tags and Variables//
NB - if you want to change a tag or variable, do it in a silent passage where possible. Doing it in a passage which has the generic actions means it runs every time you go back to it, which causes all kinds of problems

//Relevant strings//
There&#39;s a passage called relevant strings under this one where I&#39;m keeping a record of every string that we use for items, tags, knowledge datanames, etc. I think this is important because all these `(if:)` comparisons are case-sensitive and having the wrong capitalisation or punctuation can throw them off, so the version of a string in the relevant strings passage should be what you refer to when you&#39;re putting checks in the game. Update it whenever you add a new tag or whatever. Given that Twine doesn&#39;t have the concept of a Enum, this is the best way to keep the code nice and sanitary.

//Knowledge//
This is a datamap that contains three sub-datamaps for people, places and history. To add to it, use a set macro like this:

`(set: &quot;history&quot; of $knowledge to it + (datamap:&quot;The Great Schism&quot;,&quot;Whatever this is.&quot;))`

You can also check if something is known or not using something like this:

`(if: (datanames: &quot;history&quot; of $knowledge) contains &quot;The Great Schism&quot;)[You recognise the depiction of the Great Schism on the wall.]
(else:)[It&#39;s not clear what this mural depicts, but it involves people burning books and scholars wailing. A shadowy figure presides over all.]`

Sometimes a bit of knowledge might make a previous entry irrelevant or obsolete. For example, in Intro11, if you know about the Whispering Keepers, you recognise their mark and get a knowledge entry about The Bitten Tongue. Otherwise, you get a placeholder enrty called &#39;strange symbol of teeth&#39; that might be updated later on if you talk to someone, or some such thing.

//Conversation//
NOTE: The Traveller&#39;s Friend dialogue is in the past tense but the rest ought to be in the present.

To create a person who can be talked to, do the following:

1) First, add an entry for them to the InitialiseConversations passage. The datamap contains values for &quot;patience&quot;, &quot;maxpatience&quot;, &quot;timelastmet&quot;, &quot;responses&quot;, &quot;opinions&quot;, &quot;attitudes&quot;, &quot;interjections&quot;, &quot;iDontKnow&quot;, &quot;playerExit&quot;, &quot;exit&quot; and &quot;topicsDiscussed&quot;.

Here&#39;s what those things are:

patience - number - the &#39;HP&#39; of the conversation. When it gets to zero, the NPC ends the conversation. If we want characters who are going to recur or be visitable more than once, we&#39;ll need to work out how to top it back up after sufficient time is passed (SEE BELOW). It gets stored in a variable called $patience during the conversation itself so you don&#39;t have to keep typing (set: &quot;patience&quot; of $interlocutor to it - 1).

maxpatience - the maximum value of patience for this character

timelastmet - this is a record of the player variable $timeindungeon. it&#39;s set in the ConversationExit passage to whatever $timeindungeon was at that point. When a conversation happens, the conversation intialise passage checks if $timeindungeon is higher than timelastmet. If so, it tops up &quot;patience&quot; accordingly, but won&#39;t go above maxpatience (so meeting new characters will always be at their maxpatience). Should be set to 0 in intialisation 

responses - datamap of either strings or macros - The main feature of this whole system. This is the list of their responses to things you might ask them about. The datanames in this datamap must be spelled and capitalised exatctly the same as their counterparts the datanames in the &quot;knowledge&quot; datamap. The value that comes afterwards can be one of two things - either a string, if you want their response to just be text, or else a `(display:)` macro referring to a passage if you want their response to trigger some code (for example, to add an entry to the knowledge datamap). See the &quot;skullResponse&quot; passage for an example of this. If you want the response to exit the conversation entirely (for example, if someone takes you somewhere, or pushes you down a hole) then make sure you put a `(display: &quot;ConversationExit&quot;)` macro in there somewhere. Also, this doesn&#39;t need to contain an entry for every single thing in the knowledge datamap. If you ask an NPC about something that they don&#39;t know about, they&#39;ll display something from the &quot;iDontKnow&quot; entry instead. 
NEW CHANGE HERE**********************
If you want a passage-response to display ONLY itself and not the interjection or options underneath, you&#39;re advised to add this line (for example if you want the passage to lead OUT of the conversation and you don&#39;t want a mid-page link with some irrelevant stuff under it:
(set: $displayInterjections to false)\
See jailerLedgerResponse for example usage.
*********************************

opinions - datamap of numbers - This contains a list of numbers that tell you how the patience value should change in response to what you ask them about. So, everything in the &#39;responses&#39; section should also be represented here. In the tutorial conversation, the woman likes talking about the Skull and the Children&#39;s Song, but hates talking about the Arbiters. 

attitudes - datamap of strings - This contains a bunch of flavourtext that indicates how the person feels at a given moment (attitudes in the sense of &#39;she struck a diffident attitude&#39; - not very well-named probably). They are divided into warm1, warm2, cool1, cool2, cold1, cold2.

interjections - array of passage names - I wanted the conversations to be a bit more organic than just &#39;ask them lots of questions until they say go away&#39; so this was my solution to that problem. Each character can have any number of passages (must be at least one) that get displayed after they answer your question. For the Traveller&#39;s Friend these are TFBrushOff, TFQuestions and TFCoughs. These let the characters talk about something they want to talk about, by asking you questions or whatever. The brushoff one is just some flavourtext but the other two conversations affect the Friend&#39;s patience with you and also offer some insight into her character. The nice thing about this way of arranging the conversations is we can have little mini-flowchart-trees that let the dialogue go off in a direction. The only consideration here is that each branch of conversation needs to end with (display: &quot;ConversationOptions&quot;) or else the game will get stuck.

iDontKnow - array of strings - Just a couple of options for stuff the NPC says if you ask them something they don&#39;t know about (can be any length).

playerExit - string (passage title) - If the player terminates the conversation by saying farewell, what happens? For example, see TFExitPlayer. This passage should either (display:) or else have a link to somewhere on the main story tree. It must also contain (display: &quot;ConversationExit&quot;).

exit - string (passage title) - The passage that gets displayed if they become impatient with you and end the dialogue. Simillar to above. Example is TFExit. It must also contain (display: &quot;ConversationExit&quot;) and link back to the main story tree.

topicsDiscussed - an empty array - Just needs to be there to keep track of what you&#39;ve said to whom.

specialPatienceLevel - passage name string - if you want to have the patience of the person set by some special means other than the normal system, include this field and put a passage name in it. The passage named here should set `&quot;patience&quot; of $interlocutor` using whatever criteria (such as what clothes you&#39;re wearing or how hard you&#39;ve been working in the mine that day). Can also use it to stack the interjections deck, if you want (see Shad).

2) So by the time you&#39;ve put all that stuff together, you&#39;ve pretty much written the NPC. All that remains is to put the section into the main game tree that links into the conversation. To start a conversation, all you do is the following:

`(set: $interlocutor to $friend)\
(display: &quot;ConversationInitialise&quot;)\
(display: &quot;ConversationOptions&quot;)`

The first bit loads the right datamap into the $interlocutor variable, the second bit sets up some other code that helps it all to hang together, and the third bit displays the initial list of conversation options.

That&#39;s all! Simple.

//Items//
Remember to make a note of all items in the relevant strings passage. Each item has a passage associated with it (with the same name as the inventory string). That passage contains relevant bits and bobs. The important thing about these is that leaving their page, you want to (goto: (history:)&#39;s 2ndlast) as that&#39;ll correspond to wherever you were on the main tree ((history:)&#39;s last would take you to the inventory menu itself, but this should be avoided as it&#39;ll mean that any other page you visit from the inventory will send you to the wrong place).

The inventory is an array of strings, and the $clothing datamap contains slots for various body parts that could have clothes on them. Clothes you&#39;re wearing aren&#39;t in the inventory because that&#39;s conventional. We need an option for removing clothes. When you put a piece of clothing in, it is removed from the inventory and whatever was in its slot is put into the inventory. Each body part is assosciated with a variable that contains a string, such as $feetDescription or $headDescription, and these variables should be updated when you put a piece of clothing on so that the &#39;How I Look&#39; thing reads accurately. This system isn&#39;t ideal (because it won&#39;t play well with filth) but I&#39;m loathe to complicate it further at this stage.

//feelings//
any variable that&#39;s a number that stores information about the player, such as $health or $timeindungeon can be exploited for a sliding scale or feelings, as well as making use of the $playerTags section. 

In the InitialiseFeelings passage are arrays containing strings that describe each stage as the variable progresses. It&#39;s important that these are in a progressive order, and that the order matches the way the number for the associated value changes (eg. in the $healthfeeling array higher is better, but in the $timeindungeonfeeling array lower is better). the Feelings passage then calls e.g. `$healthfeeling&#39;s $health` to show the string that corresponds to the current health variable. Any more variables then simply need to be added to the playerinit, a corresponding array of progressive descriptions added to the FeelingsInit passage, and print: macro added to the Feelings passage.
NB: for this to work, variables must not go into numbers that couldn&#39;t relate to an array length. therefore, $filth can&#39;t go below 1, for example (and we&#39;ll have to have system t keep health within a certain range that&#39;s matched by the array). this is good practice anyway though. 

To make use of playertags, simply use an if:contains inside the Feelings passage


//knowledge appender//

This is for when you want to add a new dimension to some knowledge without replacing the entire category (for example, when you get some more information about something but not enough to warrant creating a whole new entry in that table). The kind of block I was having to write can be seen in Ghosts1, and a sample of this new system can be seen in Ghosts2. This system replaces that horrid mess with something like the following:

`
(set: $knowledgeCategory to &quot;history&quot;)
(set: $knowledgeName to &quot;what&#39;s below&quot;)
(set: $appendedKnowledge to &quot;whatever you want added&quot;)
(set: $newKnowledge to &quot;whatever you want the entry to say if this is the first part of it&quot;)
(display: &quot;KnowledgeAppender&quot;)
`

The script thus called first checks if &quot;what&#39;s below&quot; is already in the knowledge database, and then either appends something new to it or makes a new entry if there isn&#39;t one there already.
Note: currently not working for some reason.

SO: if you&#39;re here but without the unchained or revolution tags, that means you&#39;ve arrived at the pit on foot from some other bit of the skull and there should be appropriate hazard for being here.

If you&#39;re here unchained but without revolution, that means you&#39;ve been promoted to Pit Crew and you&#39;ve done their maggot mission (chance to tell them they&#39;re digging in the wrong place and reach the ledger) NB Clue might be to do with burial places for specific body parts (you&#39;re always digging up skulls, but the ledger is beneath the place where pelvises were buried)

If you&#39;re here unchained and with the revolution tag, that means the captors have been overthrown (check Shad&#39;s health to know if Shad is here or not)

Win states: 
Get Croach respect up to five to escape to Maggotzone
Get Resistance up to five (by getting Shad up) to get in control
Get Croach respect up high enough to tell him he&#39;s digging in the wrong place

Unfavourable exit states:
Your health gets too low: placed as bait for maggot? Resistance is set back? Given to the Cultists as a sacrifice?
Shad can die, which is a pain, but you&#39;re still trapped
