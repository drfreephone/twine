I was awake anyway, but I winced when I saw the wall lit up by the screen and heard the phone buzz against the glass. Petra would rebuke me when we (link:&quot;talked later&quot;)[talked later, if we could get Skype to hold the line for five goddamn minutes].

(click: &quot;Skype&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;Our conversation would go like this - first, we&#39;d say we missed one another. Then, we&#39;d talk about how we&#39;re both depressed and resentful all the time because we can&#39;t get shit to work out for us. Then, we&#39;d maybe get snippy with one another for not looking after ourselves enough. One or both of us would cry. We&#39;d reaffirm our love, then both hang up, quietly glad the call was over.&lt;/span&gt;

](click: &quot;anyway&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;I get into crappy habits when Petra&#39;s not around, which is all of the time and possibly forever. I can&#39;t get into any kind of rhythm. Work ends late sometimes, starts early sometimes. Some mornings I&#39;m up with the lark well before I need to be. Some nights I&#39;ll be sat in my chair, unable to summon up the energy to walk five steps into bed. So yeah, this morning I was just lying there, in my sweaty bedsheets, just watching the ceiling.&lt;/span&gt;

I made as much noise as I could, but the big hollow room swallowed the sound. At the back, in the dimness, I could make out the silhouette of our handcuffed interloper.

There were a couple of cops talking to her. (if: $mentionedpolice is false)[Jace hadn&#39;t menioned the feds. I was relieved I hadn&#39;t brought any dope with me. Not that I would have had a problem, I&#39;m sure. But it would have made me feel anxious. ]I gave them as wide a berth as possible until the coppers left, which happened around 8. After that, it was just the two of us in the whole massive room. Still, I ignored her as long as I could.

&quot;Come talk to me later!&quot; she called.

She stood up to meet the journos. She was pretty tall, though, and the railing was pretty low down. This meant that she couldn&#39;t stand up straight. She was bent sideways a little, like an adult holding hands with a child.

Back at the flat, I fell into my routine. Roll a doob, visit the corner shop, try to get Petra on Skype.

(click: &quot;Roll a doob&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;My lucky tin. Just enough left for a good number. Make an L, roll a roach, break up some dry-ass baccy. Grind, blend, roll, lick, tuck. Autofire. Petra disapproves. Petra&#39;s not here.&lt;/span&gt;

](click: &quot;visit the corner shop&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;I buy biscuits, noodles, an energy drink, two beers. I resolve to have a chat with the guy behind the counter but balk at the last minute and just nod politely as we do the transaction.&lt;/span&gt;

](click: &quot;Skype&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;For a few minutes it looks like the call might actually work. I talk enthusiastically about my weird day with the handcuff lady. I touch the screen. Then, it becomes boxes. Our voices are lost. It sounds like the bottom of the sea. We switch to instant messaging. It&#39;s no substitute. I tell Petra about Rose. Petra says I should write about it. Eventually, we say goodbye, feeling no closer to one another than at any other point.

&lt;/span&gt;]After that was all done, I sat at my computer. It looked at me with provocation. I&#39;m supposed to be blogging. It&#39;s supposed to be part of my strategy to get out of this way of life. And today //was// an interesting day. I crack my knuckles, fire up wordpress.

{(set: $currentstring to &quot;Today, I met someone strange. There was this woman who&#39;d handcuffed herself to the back of the Theatre. Everyone was making a huge fuss about it but I figured I might as well talk to her a bit, sound her out. Turned out to be a pretty weird conversation.&quot;)

&quot;They can&#39;t cut her out,&quot; he said as I hung up my coat. &quot;She persuaded them that they couldn&#39;t damage the railings because they&#39;re all listed. We had to cancel last night&#39;s performance!&quot;

&quot;Are they listed?&quot; I asked. &quot;What does that even mean?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know! Fuck knows. It means we&#39;ve got some red tape to figure out first. Can you go in there again and talk to her? Sound her out.&quot;

I said I would, but I had no intention of snooping for Jace. I figured I&#39;d see how she was doing, though. It was kind of exciting. She was sort of a celebrity, and I had unlimited access to her.

As I walked in, she was doing her makeup with a little compact. She clearly wanted to look respectable, but it was only partway sucessful. She looked tired, and dishevelled. Her suit was all creased up and the cuffs were grimy. And she needed a shower. That much was certain.

She looked cheerful enough as I walked in, though.

(if: $sheknowsjoname is false)[&quot;Jo!&quot; she said. &quot;Hello! Nice to see you. I found out your name from your boss,&quot; she added.

&quot;I found out yours from the news,&quot; I said. &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, Rose.&quot;](else:)[
&quot;Morning,&quot; she said. &quot;How&#39;s my favourite grumpy theatre employee?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; I said. &quot;How&#39;s my favourite deranged prisoner?&quot;

She laughed.

&quot;Hey,&quot; I said. &quot;So I learned your name from the news, so I guess we both know each other&#39;s names now. That&#39;s something.&quot;

She laughed again. &quot;Drat! My plan to keep my identity a secret has failed. Once again, the news media has foiled me.&quot;]

&quot;Is she still here?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Yeah, but not for much longer. There&#39;s some dudes on their way here with an angle grinder. Going to remove her.&quot;

&quot;What about the listed railings or whatever?&quot;

&quot;Oh my God, don&#39;t even get me started on the listed railings. Turns out, they&#39;re not listed at all! We spent days chasing down the owner, who turns out to be on a yaught in the Bahamas, and he doesn&#39;t give a crap, and it was all just bullshit!&quot;

He laughed and massaged his eyeballs with his thumbs.

&quot;Got to hand it to her, though. She nailed that lie. I&#39;m glad we worked it out, though. Any more cancelled performances and we&#39;d have to start firing people.&quot;

He looked at me.

Once she was free, the police picked her up under her arms and marched her out. She called out to me:

I had no idea what I was going to do with them. It was a beautiful evening, with crisp yellow light coming into my room, and the hedges outside the window deliciously green.

I did my routine: Roll a doob, visit the corner shop, try to get Petra on Skype.

(click: &quot;Roll a doob&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;Only I couldn&#39;t, because I&#39;d run out. I thought about calling the dealer, decided against it for the time being.&lt;/span&gt;

](click: &quot;visit the corner shop&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;I just sucked it up and asked the dude how his day had been. He told me a story about a stray dog. I told him about Rose. We chatted for about five minutes. I couldn&#39;t work out why I&#39;d found the idea so difficult before.&lt;/span&gt;

](click: &quot;Skype&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;For once in our fucking lives, Skype worked without a hitch. We talked for hours. We laughed a lot. We talked about Rose, but we also talked about a bunch of other stuff. I&#39;d forgotten how good it is to talk to Petra about any random crap. The problem with this long-distance thing is that every interaction gets loaded with heavy fucking dramatic weight. There&#39;s no room for leivity in it, and that&#39;s bullshit because the leivity is the whole point of a relationship, isn&#39;t it? I think it is, anyway.

&lt;/span&gt;]{(set: $currentstring to &quot;I spoke to Rose again today. I can&#39;t stop thinking about her. They carted her off. I guess she&#39;ll have a trial and stuff? I&#39;ve no idea. I wonder if I should try to contact her. It might be a waste of time.&quot;)

I never did contact Rose. Years later, there would be a stupid, pompous little plaque near where she&#39;d been sat, half-commemorating her.

&quot;This railing was removed and repaired in March 2017 after it was damaged by members of the London Metropolitan Police, who were forced to cut it up in order to remove a protester who had chained herself to this spot.&quot;

I didn&#39;t see it until years later, though. That evening, I finished my post, hit submit and closed my computer. Then I went over to the bed, lay back, looked up at the ceiling. I thought about Petra, and about Rose, and about the Prime Minister of the UK holding hands with the President of the USA. Then I thought long and hard about what I was going to do next.

<tw-passagedata pid="21" name="IntroA" tags="" position="385,286">Jace wanted me to work. I couldn&#39;t turn down a shift. That was that. Before I answered the phone, I reminded myself that this was my eleventh day in a row. I tried to quieten that thought, but it was there.

Jace didn&#39;t say much - just that there was some kind of situation, he was calling everybody, that I had to hurry, that I had to get to the theatre quick as I could, that I wasn&#39;t to talk to any press.

&#39;Press?&#39; I rubbed my eyes. &#39;Dude, what&#39;s going on? What press?&#39;

&#39;Shit,&#39; he said. &#39;Shit, I don&#39;t know, there&#39;s this situation with a woman, I keep getting calls, I don&#39;t really know yet. Just get to stage door, quick, now, hurry.&#39;

So I weighed the odds: 70/30 said this was some bullshit thing and not a real crisis. But I still couldn&#39;t turn down a shift.

[[out of bed|Bedroom Morning]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="22" name="IntroB" tags="" position="380,669">A grey morning, windy. Crud blew across the empty road. Tarmac sky, lit with trace of toothache orange. Jace wasn&#39;t lying: There really were press outside the theatre. Quite a few of them - not enough to call it a crowd. They looked chilly. Several stood outside the box office, huddled up with cups of coffee and Pret croissants.(click: &quot;Pret&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;

There was a time when I disliked people just for having the spare income for that kind of crap, but the fucked thing about this income-dependant-spousal-visa situation is that you don&#39;t even have to save money or keep it - just achieve a certain income. I bust my ass all year trying to earn the magic sum of £18,600 but it doesn&#39;t much matter what I do with that money once I&#39;ve earned it. I buy Pret coffee myself, sometimes. These days, the people I resent aren&#39;t the ones with spare income. The people I resent are the ones with the good fortune not to fall in love with a foreigner.&lt;/span&gt;]

[[i headed round to the stage door|IntroC]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="23" name="IntroC" tags="" position="368,836">I hunched my shoulders and muscled past the handful of canny journos who were waiting outside the stage door. I closed it behind me, locked it. It was dead quiet.

Jace heard me come in, and called me into the admin office. It was a pokey room, most of the floor space taken up by desks and filing cabinets and a ruined old sofa. Only one small window, high up on the wall. He was pacing around inside. He looked haggard and smelled of whiskey. He didn&#39;t look like he&#39;d had much sleep.(click: &quot;Jace&quot;)[&lt;span class = &quot;boxout&quot;&gt;

Jace was an idiot and likeable enough, but he&#39;d never figured out that important managerial knack of giving instructions without being patronising as all god-damn. Partly, this was because we were about the same age. Partly, it was because he had this way of giving you instructions with this watery apologetic smile. He was only the manager because he&#39;d worked here for longer than anyone else. He wanted to be an actor, and he figured working admin in a theatre was a good start because, I don&#39;t know, it let him hang out with real actors, or something.&lt;/span&gt;]

&quot;What&#39;s going on, dude?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Jo,&quot; he said. &quot;Thank fuck. Thank fucking god you&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Shit, Jo, it&#39;s ridiculous. We have a situation. Listen.&quot; He paused, like an actor. &quot;There&#39;s a woman in the back of the theatre.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;A woman. At the back of the circle. She&#39;s been in there all night. She saw the play yesterday evening, and then she must have hidden somewhere, and she&#39;s there now.&quot;

&quot;OK. There&#39;s a woman. I&#39;m still failing to see the crisis. Why don&#39;t we throw her out?&quot;

&quot;Well, we can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Because she&#39;s handcuffed herself to a fucking railing.&quot;

My turn to pause.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;She says it&#39;s a protest. She says she&#39;s a protester.&quot;

So that was it. My role in the crisis: Push the fucking broom around.

&quot;Dude, have you been sleeping here?&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s not the point. That&#39;s not what we&#39;re... Alright, yes. I&#39;ve been crashing on the sofa. Only for a couple of days. Don&#39;t tell anyone, man. I&#39;d only get in trouble.&quot;

At the same time, a strange divide has occurred in the most fertile ground for the production of experimental art that maybe has ever existed....It’s a culture that relies on getting it. If you don’t get it, it’s gone. A culture that thrives on this kind of art will inevitably turn away from the experimental, the conceptual, the art without purpose.

like your girl! and it also says this:

I encourage you to make your own art without purpose, without meaning. Make something challenging. Make something that requires a serious effort to make sense of. Make something within a tradition. Make something that doesn’t reward serious effort, just to throw people off the scent. Don’t let them kill postmodernism, or conceptualism, or experiment. Don’t let it kill itself by becoming institutionalised. Take it underground. Make it new.

<tw-passagedata pid="28" name="TheatreDay1A" tags="" position="391,1396">She looked somewhere in her forties. She was wearing some kind of trouser-suit in navy blue, and had straightened hair, and a large cream-coloured handkerchief spilling out of her top pocket. She was sat on the floor, with her back to the theatre wall, next to a large backpack like a hiker would have. Kind of incongruous with her outfit, I guess. I couldn&#39;t see the handcuffs - her left arm was encased in a kind of thick plastic pipe that wrapped around the railing above her, in a position that reminded me of someone holding that handle above the passenger doors in a car. She wasn&#39;t what I&#39;d imagined.

&quot;Hey,&quot; she said, as I came closer with my broom.

I was a little wary of speaking to her. She kept her eyes on me as I worked along the row, so we made eye contact whenever I glanced her way. Eventually she said &quot;Go on, talk to me. You must have a question.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; she says. &quot;Basically, have you heard of a camelback?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a sort of water bag for hikers, you keep it in your backpack. I&#39;m just going to use that, but, um, in reverse.&quot;

&quot;Well, don&#39;t make a mess. I&#39;m the one that&#39;ll have to clean it up.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I did a couple of practice runs.&quot;

&quot;Just as well. I was worried there would be a neat row of yellow bottles for me to dispose of.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s your perogative,&quot; she said. &quot;And it&#39;s my perogative to keep my motivations a secret.&quot;

&quot;But you said you&#39;re protesting about something.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;So how can you expect to achieve anything if you&#39;re not going to say what it is you&#39;re protesting about?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an interesting question.&quot; (set: $dialogueoptions to it + (a:&quot;so you&#39;re really not going to tell anyone your reasons for doing this&quot;))

<tw-passagedata pid="56" name="is it about the play" tags="" position="3895,50">(display: &quot;NewConvoSegment&quot;)&quot;Just tell me. Is it about this theatre? Is it about the play we&#39;re showing at the moment?&quot;

&quot;What makes you ask?&quot;

I looked at the stage. We were hosting a production of The Disappearance Of Yorgos Loizos, a play about a woman disappearing from the Natural History Museum.

&quot;There were some people picketing it on opening night, something to do with the way the play whitewashes a real alien abduction.&quot;

She raised her eyebrows. &quot;No,&quot; she says. &quot;I hadn&#39;t heard anything about that. And I thought the play was very good, incedentally.&quot;

I wondered about this.

You&#39;re not going to admit what this is about?&quot;

Out of nowhere, inexplicably, I found myself becoming angry.

&quot;But that&#39;s ridiculous! You know what this means, right? Maybe you&#39;ve got some highminded idea that you&#39;ll become, I don&#39;t know, some kind of symbol? Like this will all stand for something? You&#39;ll become a figurehead of some weird sort, because of your refusal? But it won&#39;t work like that! Everyone&#39;s going to put words into your mouth. Or else... Or else people will think you&#39;re some kind of crank, just a nutter. This won&#39;t be about anything. You&#39;ll become some... Some bit of weird apocrypha.&quot;

She didn&#39;t respond, so I kept going.

&quot;Are you just doing this because you think it&#39;s amusing? Does this make you feel better somehow? Is it even about the world outside? Is this just some thing you&#39;re doing for your own sake? Because it feels right, or something?&quot;

She said nothing.

&quot;Is this all some sort of joke?&quot;

She looked down at her knees. I looked for her facial expression. Her eyes looked weary.

It&#39;s a lifestyle. You&#39;re either doing it all the time, or not at all. That&#39;s why looking after yourself is a revolutionary act, by the way. That&#39;s why self-care matters.&quot;

&quot;Did you ever hear about the umbrella man? He’s in a lot of those JFK assassination videos. He’s this guy, standing by the motorcade right where the shots were fired. He’s on the other side of the road to the knoll. It was a beautiful sunny day, everyone knows, but there is this one guy there, right where the thing happened, and he’s standing under a black umbrella. This is true. You look at the footage, you’ll see him. Well, people had all kinds of ideas about that guy. I remember seeing diagrams of umbrellas with guns attached in ingenious ways. Triggers hidden in the handle. Sightlines on the spokes. There was a big campaign to find him, because people had to have an answer. Maybe he was the missing piece of the puzzle. So anyway, they found him, eventually, after months and I mean months of research, calling around Dallas hotels, telephoning people who’d been there, or who’d been drinking in Dallas the night before, eventually it came good. They went and spoke to him. Was he the shooter? Was he someone dangerous, some criminal nut, some CIA man? Was he shit. Of course not. This guy, he was a protester. Get this - he was carrying that umbrella because it was a reference to Neville Chamberlain. Neville Chamberlain! Because he used to hold an umbrella. Who the fuck sees an umberlla and immediately thinks Neville Chamberlain? Well, the answer is this guy. This guy was protesting the policy of appeasement, from before the war, like 30 years out-of-date. Nothing to do with JFK, even. What did he hope to gain by turning up that day under an umbrella? I mean, it literally took months to figure out what he was about. Not a very effective protest, was it? Who knows. He was a crank, a real one. The truth of it was one million miles away from any idea that anyone had about what he was doing there. On the level of people, all kinds of eccentric shit happens. You can’t predict it, but you can’t count on it either. But here I am, sitting here, talking to you, talking to the press.&quot;

You guys got to take that for granted.&quot;

I stopped to get my breath.

&quot;Jesus,&quot; I said. &quot;Sorry, carried away.&quot;

<tw-passagedata pid="82" name="PetraSituation" tags="" position="3681,198">(set: $introducedPetraSituation to true)&quot;Here&#39;s the bare bones of it. Petra and I met a couple of years ago, in London. We both lived here. We dated for a while, and figured out we wanted to be together. But, the problem is that Petra&#39;s from America. Once Petra&#39;s visa was up, we had to split apart. So normally the solution would be to get married, right? Only since 2012, in this country, you&#39;ve also had to meet this thing called the Financial Requirement. It&#39;s because we&#39;re all so shit-scared of immigration, I assume, but basically if you earn less that £18,600 then you&#39;re shit out of luck and you can&#39;t live with the person you love. That&#39;s how it is. It was the current Prime Minister that introduced it, back in 2012, when she was home secretary under Mr. Pigface. She&#39;s Prime Minister now, the evil fucking asshole. And I&#39;m on a fucked up contract, another Conservative legacy, so I don&#39;t have a rigid salary. So I basically need to earn enough in the next few months and then we can be together. I mean, I&#39;m nearly there, and soon we&#39;ll be able to hook it up, bring Petra back over here...&quot;

Up close, it looked like a bit of pvc pipe, shaped like a t-junction. The top of the T was around the railing, and her arm dangled out of the bottom of it.

&quot;It&#39;s called a sleeping dragon,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s to stop the authorities just cutting through the handcuffs. I&#39;m cuffed to the rail under here, too.&quot;

&quot;How did you get it over the pipe?&quot;

&quot;I brought it here cut into two parts, then glued it in place with epoxy overnight after I&#39;d attached my hand. Epoxy is good stuff. The only way you&#39;d get this off now is with a buzzsaw. And obviously, my hand&#39;s underneath, so they can&#39;t do that.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re kind of holding your own arm hostage? Kind of like saying &#39;Don&#39;t cut this, or I&#39;ll bleed everywhere.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Sure, if you want to think of it like that. People used to make more elaborate ones, full of concrete and stuff. They&#39;d use them to form human chains around a tree they didn&#39;t want felled, or whatever. This is a bit more unusual.&quot;

&quot;You know we&#39;re doing something right!&quot; he yelled. &quot;We must be doing something right because we&#39;ve got liberals all around the world falling over in confusion.

&quot;Well, it isn&#39;t empty now.&quot;

&quot;What do you... Oh.&quot;

&quot;And it&#39;s a bit more, ahem, theatrical, which helps with the press angle. But as a matter of fact I chose this place because it&#39;s full of original features. If I&#39;d chained myself to a railing somewhere in Picadilly Circus, they&#39;d just cut the railing, but this way they&#39;ll have to fret about some beauraucracy first.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a surprisingly childish attitude,&quot; she replied.

&quot;What?&quot; I said, surprised.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s childish. All your criticisms there, they all revolve around the idea that the play didn&#39;t do the stuff that you expected it to do. It went off in its own direction, it ignored your expectations. That makes it a mature work of art, I think.&quot;

&quot;Hm,&quot; she said. &quot;Almost.&quot;
