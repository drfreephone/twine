<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="a" tags="" position="256,460">Hey, so. Listen. I&#39;ve been thinking, about this communication problem. Did you ever play that game Twenty Questions?

[[Yes|a1]]
[[No|a2]]
[[I Don&#39;t Know|a2]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="a1" tags="" position="172,604">Right. One person asks questions and the other person responds with yes or no, and you have to figure out what the other person&#39;s thinking of. So you know how in that game, the secret is really just to ask the right questions. The most efficient question is one that divides the possible answer-space in half. So you&#39;re trying to work out the identity of one object out of all the possibilities in the entire universe, in the entire language, and that sounds impossible, but you can do it if your questions are efficient enough.

<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="a2" tags="" position="311,600">Oh, alright. Well, it works like this. It&#39;s this game where one person asks questions, and the other person is only allowed to answer &#39;yes&#39; and &#39;no&#39;. So, it&#39;s kind of like our current predicament. The idea of the game is that the person answering the questions is thinking of something. It can be anything. And the person asking the questions has to figure out what it is, by asking twenty questions or less. Do you get what I mean?

[[Yes|a3]]
[[No|a4]]
[[I Don&#39;t Know|a4]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="a3" tags="" position="184,772">Oh, cool. (display: &quot;a5&quot;)</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="6" name="a4" tags="" position="324,764">Oh. Well, it doesn&#39;t really matter. The important thing, from an informational viewpoint, is that twenty questions, each with two possible answers, is normally enough to figure out what the person&#39;s thinking of. Which is certainly an unintuitive result, when you first hear about it. Twenty questions doesn&#39;t feel like enough resolution to figure out what a person&#39;s thinking of, when they could be thinking of literally anything in the entire universe. But it is. The trick, really, is to ask the right questions.

[[Yes|a5]]
[[No|a5]]
[[I Don&#39;t Know|a6]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="7" name="a5" tags="" position="160,924">Well, I only mention it in order to suggest that our situation isn&#39;t hopeless. There&#39;s still plenty of scope for us to communicate usefully, even with this daft yes/no system.

[[Yes|a1]]
[[No|a2]]
[[I Don&#39;t Know|a2]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="8" name="a6" tags="" position="316,928">No, it&#39;s totally true. That&#39;s how it works. Anyway, my point is that the game sifts specific information out of general information using only very simple differentiation matrices. And that&#39;s kind of like the situation we&#39;re in now, don&#39;t you think? Even though we&#39;re thwarted by this absurd hand-feedback device, we can probably still communicate meaningfully, but the onus is very much on me to know what to ask.</tw-passagedata>
