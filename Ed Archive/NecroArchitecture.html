ginfo (click-replace: &quot;ginfo&quot;)[
N.B. This is the genericroom. It&#39;s the room that the State Manager sends you to if you&#39;re in the Active (i.e. not in initiative) state. It has the traversal options for that room as well as the generic actions (inventory, etc) and above those it displays a &quot;room&quot; passage, which might have links and descriptive text and stuff in it. It&#39;s basically a template for your general-purpose environment+upkeep panels.

These are the rooms that the procedural generator places. They&#39;re &#39;generic&#39; in the sense that they all have a datamap with their information and they all obey a simillar format and when you come out of a fight or something, you&#39;ll always be plonked into one of these. The game has an index of them that it uses to build the world. Or rather, it will do eventually.

Note that not every passage has to be a genericroom - it&#39;s fine for passages to link to other passages connected to them without routing through the StateManager. A room might have a machine to investigate over there and a mural to check over there and an annex at the back, and they can all just be passages of their own that link together with straightforward link: macros. The only thing to consider then is that those rooms won&#39;t by default have access to the inventory or the traversal options. If those things are needed, you can just display: them manually.

One final thought: A biome might be laid out as follows. Consider a biome that is a creature&#39;s burrow. The first room is the entrance. That would be a GenericRoom, with options to leave to any other connected rooms. Then you might move through some standalone passages - a hole to squeeze through, a scrap of paper in the mouth of a skull, an encounter with the creature that lives here, etc. - and eventually get where you were headed, which is the far end of the burrow where they&#39;ve burrowed into the basement of a dilapidated shack. This would be another GenericRoom, which would display the traversal options for wherever the shack connected to.]</tw-passagedata>

einfo (click-replace: &quot;einfo&quot;)[
This room is a genericroom with an encounter. This section of the passage is displayed if the player is in a room with a conspicuous hazard but isn&#39;t necessarily in immediate peril. For example, being in a room with a creature that doesn&#39;t pay any attention to you, like a blind monk or a rat eating a corpse. You&#39;ll need to negotiate that situation somehow, and it might involve going to the fight planner or the sneak planner or something.
If there was immediate peril, we&#39;d do a state change. If that was the case, we&#39;d be straight into a fight or sneak situation (presumably when it comes to entering a new room you have some option about whether to smash the door down or open it quietly or whatever, so you may be immediately into a situation (smash a door if you don&#39;t have the key, but they&#39;ll know you&#39;re coming. Conversely, sneak in if you want but you&#39;ll be at a disadvantage if discovered). 
If there&#39;s no hazard, a longer bit of descriptive text is displayed (replete with options to examine stuff, places to go, etc) to reflect the fact that you can have a proper look at the place.
This is how rooms should be formatted if they&#39;re going to contain a monster to fight.]]

<tw-passagedata pid="18" name="ToDo" tags="" position="70,21">- put the planners in, make them work in some sensible way.

- import some of the fight stuff from the previous big build into this architecture
- build some sample rooms to explore concepts of genericroom, hazards, sneaking, panels, standard-monster-interaction-options, etc.
- concept of monsters
- concept of items

-conversations: each character has a datamap of what is known (rats live in holes, rats eat cheese, rats smell of shit, etc) and when they tell you something, it gets added into an &#39;already mentioned&#39; datamap (or else its index does or something but it&#39;s probably not an issue).
- each character has a datamap where they store things you&#39;ve told them. At this stage, this is all strings, generated out of a corupus.
- issue: your list of &#39;things to ask about&#39; will be structured in much the same way as their list of responses, so it might feel a bit less prone to excitement. Sometimes they should synthesize stories about what the rats did, etc.</tw-passagedata>
