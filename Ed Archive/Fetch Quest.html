</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Start" tags="" position="51,108">Fetch Quest is an attempt to tell the simplest possible RPG sub-plot story, but with a great many different variables that determine what the content of that story looks and feels like. The idea was to get a broad range of different outcomes that emerge from only a handful of decision points. This probably isn&#x27;t the best way to do IF, but it has nevertheless been an interesting experiment in Twine. 

After you finish, try playing it again with a different combination of options. Something very different might happen. Or you might get entirely the same outcome, but with a whole load of superficial differences. Who knows! 

There are about 10,000 words in here and it&#x27;s probably riddled with typos. Apologies if that&#x27;s a problem for you.

I can be contacted on epsibley@gmail.com for corrections, comments, queries, etc.

Enjoy!

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Intro" tags="" position="301,103">The journey took longer than you expected, rumbling across the dirt of $IWorldName. Just you, $IName, and the $IConveyance. You think back to $IQuestGiver$IQuestGiverBumf, rambling at you for hours about this crazy mission. This mission you&#x27;re on right now. This plan that&#x27;s just desperate enough to work. A decisive move that might finally get one over on the $IVillainTeam, {(if: $Setting is 1)[and stop their reign of senseless destruction from taking any more lives.](else-if: $Setting is 2)[which is a sentence you never thought you&#x27;d catch yourself thinking. This is it - a chance to discover out what malevolent secret they&#x27;ve keeping in that vault all these years. Orbulon and his spies have spent years trying to get hold of the blueprint. Last night, months of planning and negotiation came to a head. You were assigned to collect the blueprint from a man in an alley in Zabraxis-6. But things didn&#x27;t play out how you would have liked. Long story short, the deal went south, fast, and the blueprint fell into the hands of a nefarious crime lord, Augustus Duke, who hides out in a long-forgotten pleasure resort halfway across the galaxy.](else:)[and get all that bullion out of the bank in Traceyville. Then you might be able to leave this rotten mess behind you, once and for all. The Dead Eye Gang killed your cousin, they killed John Cole, and they killed little Rosie from the Drug Store. There would never be any justice for any of that, but maybe, just maybe, if you could get that gold, you could just leave without having to spend the rest of your life looking over your shoulder.]}

$IQGg words echo in your ears, over the sound of the $IConveyance. &quot;Go to $IWorldName! Steal the $IQuest! That&#x27;s the only way. I know where it is. It&#x27;s in the $IFacility. Time is short, though. They&#x27;ll be moving out at midnight. You&#x27;ll have to get there before they carry it away. It&#x27;ll be in the chamber at the heart of the $IFacility.&quot;

{(if: $Setting is 1)[He](else-if: $Setting is 2)[He](else:)[She]} went on to explain, at length, that the $IVillainTeam needs the $IQuest {(if: $Setting is 1)[to remain upon the altar of the Immolated God at all times, lest their arcane power and uncanny strength desert them.](else-if: $Setting is 2)[to remain hidden if their plans for intergalactic domination were to succeed.

Hell, those bastards probably can&#x27;t even read.

You trust Marya&#x27;s information. She has eyes in places you wouldn&#x27;t believe.]}

Your problem is that the $IQuest is in the hands of $IVillain, known throughout $IWorldName as a masterful {(if: $Setting is 1)[conjurer]
(else-if: $Setting is 2)[logistician]
(else:)[bank-robber]} and a bastard to boot. He&#x27;s not one to be tampered with. And what&#x27;s worse, the $IFacility will certainly be guarded and fortified when you arrive.

But you won&#x27;t arrive alone. Riding alongside you, eyes glued to the horizon, is $IName, {(if: $Companion is 1)[your best friend since you were seven years old. There was no way you were coming to $IWorldName without $ISPron. {(if: $Gender is 1)[He has](else-if: $Gender is 2)[She has](else:)[They have]} fine blonde hair, cropped short around the temples, and large blue eyes that used to make you envious as a kid.](else-if: $Companion is 2)[an old-timer who spend most of $IPPron youth living in a hut near $IFacility, sneaking in and out when nobody was looking.

It&#x27;s a shame that {(if: $Gender is 1)[he is](else-if: $Gender is 2)[she is](else:)[they are]} so fragile-looking.

It&#x27;s true that $IPron used to get on your nerves with $ISPron constant chatter, but these days you feel safer knowing that $IName&#x27;s got your back.]}

You remember the first thing $IPron ever said to you, {(if: $Companion is 1)[back when you were seven years old, lying on the floor of the orphanage, that first morning, unable to move for grief. &quot;Hey,&quot; $IPron said. &quot;Hey, don&#x27;t cry. It can&#x27;t be that bad.&quot; {(if: $Gender is 1)[He was](else-if: $Gender is 2)[She was](else:)[They were]}  wrong, of course. In that moment, you were experiencing the purest sadness that you ever felt in your life. But still, you&#x27;ve stuck together ever since, through thick and thin.](else-if: $Companion is 2)[after $IQuestGiver put you in touch with one another. &quot;Jeez,&quot; $IPron said. &quot;They don&#x27;t breed them like they used to.&quot; You just smiled a thin smile.](else:)[whispering &quot;hold onto this for me,&quot; as $IPron pushed past you through a crowd, being pursued by two burly policemen. When you looked to see what $IPron had handed you, it was a single shiny coin that $IPron must have fished out of someone&#x27;s pocket. It seemed like too much trouble, for something so small. When $IPron came back to find you later, you got to talking, and eventually $IPron decided that {(if: $Gender is 1)[he was](else-if: $Gender is 2)[she was](else:)[they were]} going to stick with you, whether you liked it or not. So far, $IPPron utility had outweighed $IPPron propensity for trouble making. So far.]}

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Guard" tags="" position="598,103">{(if: $Setting is 1)[$IWorldName is bad country. Not even the most wretched wildlife lives here. All day, you see nothing but scab-flies, three needlers on a carcass, and one of the Northern dragons overhead for a moment. How did it get so bad here? Is it the influence of the cult, the $IQuest, something else? &lt;p&gt;

You stop to rest and make some food in the hottest part of the afternoon. You and $IName don&#x27;t talk much. The water has gone bad, so you have to boil it. You keep the fire as small as you can.&lt;p&gt;

In the evening, you awaken surrounded by ash people. As you rise to your feet, one of them collapses with a thump and disintegrates. The other two drift away over a dune. You shudder. You&#x27;ve always hated ash people. $IName is asleep, and doesn&#x27;t see them.&lt;p&gt;

You feel exposed out here.&lt;p&gt;

Your destination is easy to find: At the centre of Ometh Isle is a pillar of charcoal, two miles high. It&#x27;s a blasted place. The ground around the tree is the colour of ash. And the land reflects the sky, which is the colour of ash also. And what are the ashen tunnels? Those are caves that were its roots. Caked in ash, baked into the earth. What was this tree? It used to reach halfway to heaven. It was an Ash. A World-Ash, in fact. To burn such a tree is a sin.&lt;p&gt;

Amid a maze of dead wood and bones, you find the entrance to the tunnels.](else-if: $Setting is 2)[The desert is crossed by long dead-straight red and white lines, strips of stone and blistered metal scored under the cool gaze of the Zorgox Arbitration beams.&lt;p&gt;

The shadow of the doom of pleasure swells out of the horizon, scarred along its scalp by the rake of another decades-old Arbitration Beam. Despite this, however, the structure seems remarkably intact. The dome has retained its shape, even though much of the glass has been discoloured or broken.&lt;p&gt;

Some time - more than you would like - passes as you scout the circumference of the dome. Everywhere is detritus. The Duke&#x27;s boys have been cleaning the place out. Old styrofoam fixtures, bed frames, a gutted orgasmotron, a pile of rotted old-world tapestries.](else:)[$IWorldName is mis-named, in your opinion. It&#x27;s more like a... what, a mesa? A plateau? In the distance, a shelf of rock rises over the horizon. Pastel stripes of sediment. At the floor of the shelf, the entrance to $IFacility. A bird somewhere makes a noise like an old hinge.]}

In front of the door, a drunken warden takes his ease.

You move inside. Around a corner and down a flight of stairs, you come across a $IBox. It looks newer, cleaner, and more regularly used than any of the other detritus that litters the narrow corridors. The symbol of the $IVillainTeam has been hastily painted on the side. $IName eyes it.

&quot;We don&#x27;t have time waste,&quot; you say. &quot;We have to push onwards.&quot;
&quot;But wait!&quot; says $IName. &quot;Maybe this is it? Maybe this is box with the $IQuest in it? We know they&#x27;re moving it out tonight. Perhaps they put it in here?&quot;

It&#x27;s quiet. Aside from the mess, there is little sign of the $IVillainTeam.

As you penetrate deeper into the $IFacility, the light gets thinner. {(if: $Setting is 1)[The walls, previously grey, become black. Cracks appear, and lengthy spears of charcoal litter the ground. The air is thick and bitter. Your eyes begin to water. You get turned around. &quot;The centre of the tunnels.&quot; That&#x27;s where you&#x27;re meant to be going.

(else-if: $Setting is 2)[A smell of mildew fills the air. Couches and futons, rotten velvet and hyper-silk, bits of clothing, broken bottles.

Speed, that&#x27;s the key. Moving quickly, you close the space between you and the guard. Before he knows what&#x27;s what, you bring your $ICloseUp down on the his $IGuardClothes and...

He looks you in the eye. &quot;Is that the best you&#x27;ve got, kid?&quot; His breath is bitter. And then, moving with a speed that astonishes you, he grabs a $IEnemyWeapon from behind an old crate and levels it at $IName. By the time you are able to get your $ICloseUp round again, he&#x27;s loosed a shot. $IName calls out in pain and crumples to the ground. Still, at least it was over quickly.

Well, the guard is the only person nearby. That much is certain. A sortie around the area reveals what you suspected: There&#x27;s no other way in. You contemplate your options, whispering with $IName from behind a blasted tree-stump. After a minute, you hear a crash. The guard has collapsed to the ground.

$IName loves this maneuver. When you were kids, this is how it would work: $IName would pull a rag over $IPPron face. $IPron would take a piece of paper and approach the mark, gabbling incoherently, asking the mark to read the paper, to look at something. $IPron would get the paper right up in the mark&#x27;s face, and then as soon as the mark&#x27;s face was obscured by the paper, you would burst out of nowhere and give the mark a haymaker to the solar plexus. They never saw it coming.

The guard crumples to the ground.

Aha! Just as you thought, the box is trapped. Behind the box you find a filament of wire connecting the lid of the $IBox to something under the surface of the ground. Something dangerous or explosive, certainly.

However, as you are checking it out, a $IThug appears. Shots are fired. $IName takes a hit. A loud noise rings out. You have no choice but to shoot him(if: $Setting is 1)[ with an arrow].

The $IBox is still there. No time for fiddly disarming procedures: You either have to grit your teeth and open the thing in spite of the trap, or move on.

With a searing pain, death takes you. As you fall, you see a scrap of $IName&#x27;s cloak through the open doors. You&#x27;ll see $ISPron again in just a moment, you think to yourself. Is that what your blood looks like? Guess so.&lt;p&gt;

It isn&#x27;t so easy for $IName. You grab the $IQuest and turn around just in time to see $IName vanish amid a goonish scrum. You run over and are able to pull $ISPron out. The two of you beat a hasty retreat. All the way back through the $IFacility, the bastards chase you. You don&#x27;t get a chance to take stock of your wounds until you get back to the $IConveyance.

You turn in your seat to tell $IName, and realise that $IPPron face is white, and $IPPron arms are slack at $IPPron sides. How did that happen? You find yourself overtaken by shock, and for some time you can&#x27;t work out what to do. Eventually, you stop the $IConveyance. You climb down, and catch $IName as $IPPron body falls to the ground.

You bury $ISPron. That&#x27;s all there is to say about it. You bury $ISPron, and you ride off alone. You can&#x27;t bare to look at the $IQuest. It makes you feel sick. The whole thing makes you feel sick.
