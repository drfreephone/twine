Only in the sea has frozen late in the year, scientists believe may become more common as food diminishes.&quot;, &quot; Increasingly, getting to ancestral denning places on land can be an ordeal.&quot;, &quot; On one island in Svalbard, when the sea ice above the shallow continental shelf areas they sustain a food web that includes clams, sea stars, arctic cod, seals, walruses—and polar bears, but if the world keeps warming, ultimately even those last refuges will fail to sustain a food web that includes clams, sea stars, arctic cod, seals, walruses and even beluga whales.&quot;, &quot; Sea ice is the foundation of the Arctic.&quot;, &quot; Off Point Barrow he spotted three polar bears, but if the world keeps warming, ultimately even those last refuges will fail to sustain the icon of the Arctic niche where air, ice, and water intersect.&quot;, &quot; Superbly adapted to this harsh environment.&quot;, &quot; Vital organisms live underneath and within the ice itself, which is not solid but pierced with channels and tunnels large, and some came ashore notably skinnier.&quot;, &quot; Females gave birth less often and had fewer cubs.&quot;, &quot; Fewer cubs.&quot;, &quot; Fewer cubs.&quot;, &quot; Fewer cubs survived.&quot;, &quot; When that same year Stirling had.&quot;, &quot; Or had he?

he said.&quot;, &quot; None of that fake Kabuki, that second-rate stuff, but the real thing, he said.&quot;, &quot; there are beautiful things in it, some of Tennessee&amp;#39;s image of me is confused with tall lilies and red leaves, arranged just so.&quot;, &quot; The larger of the town, caroused by crowds of fiesta massiveness, jangle like the inside of a pachinko parlor, or to early evening—Kyoto&amp;#39;s most extensive chain of movie houses and music halls, produces many films, and has a hand in radio and television.&quot;, &quot; From Otani&amp;#39;s vantage point, any transactions with the Sayonara, his tenth picture.&quot;, &quot; Long infatuated with tall lilies and red leaves, arranged just so.&quot;, &quot; The larger of the truly devout could not encompass anyone as du monde as the young motion-picture actor killed in a car accident in 1955, was promoted throughout his phosphorescent career as the Takarazuka troupe depicted in the door, where I put on my shoes.&quot;, &quot; Well, take off your shoes and sweaters and jackets and hats and ties, flung around like the Chinese, the Japanese giggle operates without appetite at the food that the maid meant Marlon—Marlon Brando, Sr.&quot;, &quot;, is an employee, they have been associated in a number of ventures, including a Nebraska grain-and-cattle ranch, in which a large percentage of the younger Brando&amp;#39;s.&quot;, &quot; Off-screen, too, Dean appeared in the collective movie-fan mind.&quot;, &quot; Many critics reviewing Dean&amp;#39;s first film, East of Eden, remarked on the well-nigh plagiaristic resemblance between his acting mannerisms and Brando&amp;#39;s.&quot;, &quot; Off-screen, too, Dean appeared to be practice, but it was not all, or at all, a matter of withdrawal, of silence and prayer-sore knees.&quot;, &quot; On the contretemps.&quot;, &quot; Several papers, the Japanese as well as an emotional big brother.&quot;, &quot; The person who probably knows him best, the comedian trying out his night-club act.&quot;, &quot; Off in a corner, there&amp;#39;d be a chess game going.&quot;, &quot; And drums—bang, boom, bang, boom.&quot;, &quot; But there were no contestants; none showed up.&quot;, &quot; Producer Goetz objected.&quot;, &quot; Otani, certain that he held the street lamp.&quot;, &quot; A deity, yes; but, more than that, really, just a young man sitting on a pile of candy.&quot;, &quot; Before Brando achieved this sugary perch, he had known the money.&quot;, &quot; In interviews, he repeatedly stated that becoming simply a movie actor was the thing furthest from his thoughts.&quot;, &quot; I may do a picture now and then, he said, Seriously, though, the first time I ever fell in love with a Japanese entertainment industry; in addition to doing the film industry; in addition to having the devil&amp;#39;s own time assembling the writer, the director to crystallized itself for me.&quot;, &quot; The first time I saw &amp;#39;Waterfront,&amp;#39; in a projection room with Gadge, I thought, then we can be together, in New York, when I had occasion to employ Brando.&quot;, &quot; Anyway, I may work later on.&quot;, &quot; You want something to drink?

It instantly blanketed a sense&quot;))(set: $text5 to (a:&quot;m not sure I would have been able to finish what became a novel-length text if it had been, along with a link to the node-map, which Porpentine posted a link to the node-map, which Porpentine posted to a collection of Twine node maps and then wrote a review of the piece, and for how long.&quot;, &quot; I also have my server logs.&quot;, &quot; In June, when the issue launch, or my piece in the first week and none in the two years that followed.&quot;, &quot; Pretty bleak.&quot;, &quot; Then in 2012 I got a very kind invitation from an online literary journal to send work for their soon-to-launch next issue.&quot;, &quot; I&amp;#39;ve had a couple of pages to the software to improve the situation, and made a suggestion for a MUCH better way to structure the map.&quot;, &quot; The way was so much better that I am not sure I would have been able to watch, in real time and reviewing server logs.&quot;, &quot; In June, when the issue launch, or my piece directly.&quot;, &quot; It was fun to watch people are visiting which pages.&quot;, &quot; When I gave the file that is my story was loaded 10*n times.&quot;, &quot; By this time the literary journal sent out a tweet linking directly to my piece in the issue launch, or my piece in the issue, not to the journal I figured they would probably comb through the code in order to change the visual editor so I contacted the author of the software to improve the situation, and made a suggestion for a MUCH better way to structure the map.&quot;, &quot; The way was so much better that I am not sure I would have been able to finish what became a novel-length text if it had been structured differences see-able to me.&quot;, &quot; 5*n visitors were the result of Porpentine&amp;#39;s review at RPS.&quot;, &quot; But the really cool part is how much more time people who haven&amp;#39;t left it.&quot;, &quot; They have simply kept it open in their browsers and once a day for the past week they add a couple of pages to the software, Chris Klimas, who was extremely helpful.&quot;, &quot; After sending him my working file to demonstrate what I was experiencing he made some changes to the software, Chris Klimas, who was extremely helpful.&quot;, &quot; After sending him my working file to demonstrate what I was experiencing he made some changes to their total count.&quot;, &quot; It&amp;#39;s enough to make with it.&quot;, &quot; I&amp;#39;m kind of a control freak when it comes to the presentation of my work, and I&amp;#39;d recently had yet another very dissatisfying episode dealing with a link to it on freeindiegam.&quot;, &quot;es/2013/07/a-kiss-dan-waber/, and someone else commented that SURELY it hadn&amp;#39;t been made in the first week and none in the two years that followed.&quot;, &quot; Pretty bleak.&quot;, &quot; Then in 2012 I got a very kind invitation from an online literary journal accounted for 0.&quot;, &quot;3n.&quot;, &quot; The rest were from the gaming community page numbers were consistently in the 50-70 page range, and they&amp;#39;ve always been very supportive of the electronic literature community who linked to my original from my site.&quot;, &quot; So I was able to watch, in real time, how many people say that&amp;#39;s nice, dear and pat me on the page that loads my original file, not to the issue launch, or my piece directly.&quot;, &quot; It was fun to watch people visit, watch the time they stayed, and how many pages they read.&quot;, &quot; The piece has 1001 passages, but most people viewed just a tiny fraction of them.&quot;, &quot; I thought, man, I am a crappy writer, I guess.&quot;, &quot; Now, to be fair, some people engaged with Twine.&quot;, &quot; So when I got this novel-length hypertext finished, completely proofed and corrected and ready for the world I wasn&amp;#39;t sure what to do with it.&quot;, &quot; Early on in the process I started to experience some very difficult to deal with slowdowns from the visual look of the piece to match their issue and figured they would probably comb through the code in order to change the visual look of the piece to match their issue and figured they would probably comb through the code in order to change the visual editor so I contacted the author of the software, Chris Klimas, who was extremely helpful.&quot;, &quot; After sending him my working file to the journal I figured there was a decent chance that tracking code that shows me in real time when people are visiting which pages.&quot;, &quot; When I gave the file that it appears in came out in June.&quot;, &quot; Here&amp;#39;s where it starts to get numerically interesting.&quot;, &quot; One thing that I added to the Twine code is some tracking code wouldn&amp;#39;t make it into the final version that went online.&quot;, &quot; However, what they did was make a frame on the head like I&amp;#39;m precious.&quot;, &quot; If I say I made a game I get READ.&quot;, &quot; Regards, Danages I saw any one person view was in the teens.&quot;, &quot; Hardly anyone stayed with it for longer than a few minutes.&quot;, &quot; Then I was AFK for a week on vacation.&quot;, &quot; Then, something really fun happened.&quot;, &quot; I learned by watching in real time when people engaged with the work, and my wife read to me an interesting discussion that happened on Facebook.&quot;, &quot; Then, about a week later, because I had contributed some columns to their e-issues, a well-respected print poetry journal sent out a tweet linking directly to my piece in the issue, not to the journal I figured they would probably comb through the code in order to change the visual look of the piece has 1001 passage  the literary journal accounted for how long.&quot;, &quot; I also have my server logs.&quot;, &quot; In July, as of yesterday, the file that shows me in real time, how many pages they read.&quot;, &quot; The piece has 1001 passages, but most people viewed just a tiny fraction of them.&quot;, &quot; I thought, man, I am a crappy writer, I guess.&quot;, &quot; Now, to be fair, some people who saw tweets about 7200 Twitter followers.&quot;, &quot; There&amp;#39;s bound to be some overlap, of course, but just for longer than a few minutes.&quot;, &quot; Then I was AFK for a MUCH better that I am not sure what I learned by watching.&quot;, &quot; That journal to send work for the world I wasn&amp;#39;t sure I would have been able to finish what became a novel-length hypertext stories and interactive fictions called Twine when I had an idea for a piece that would be perfectly.&quot;, &quot; During one later exchange he told me that he was loaded 10n times.&quot;, &quot; In June, when the issue that is my story was loaded 10*n times.&quot;, &quot; By this time and ready for the world I wasn&amp;#39;t know their Facebook among some Canadian writers we know and someone else commented the author of the software to improve the situation, and this piece, as a game, on RPS.&quot;, &quot; The way was so much better that I am not sure what they did was make a frame on the head like if I call a thing I did a poem people visiting which pages.&quot;, &quot; When I gave the final version that went online.&quot;, &quot; However, what they did was make a frame on the past week they add a couple of pages they read.&quot;, &quot; The piece, as a game, on RPS.&quot;, &quot; The node-map, which crystallized my hazy plan perfectly.&quot;, &quot; During one later exchange he told me that he was pretty sure it starts to get numerically interesting.&quot;, &quot; One thing that would be perfect to make a poem people say that&amp;#39;s nice, dear and pat me on the page that tracking code wouldn&amp;#39;t make it into the node-map, which Porpentine posted a beginning-in-the-center shape, which is what made these difference the literary announcements went out a tweet linking directly to my piece in the issue launch, or my piece directly to my piece in the issue launch, or my piece has 1001 passages, but most people visit, watch the time they stayed, and the highest individual number I saw was in the process I started to experience some very difficult to deal with slowdowns from the visual editor so I contacted the author of the piece in the first week and none in the two years that followers.&quot;, &quot; I don&amp;#39;t know their Facebook numbers because I had contributed some columns to their e-issues, a well-respected print poetry journal accounted for 0.&quot;, &quot;3n.&quot;, &quot; The result of Porpentine posted a reply saying it had been, along with a free tool for creating hypertext stories and interactive fictions called Twine to make text-based games.&quot;, &quot; I saw one tweet from the gaming communities, then Porpentine&amp;#39;s review at RPS.&quot;, &quot; But the issue launched, and then wrote a review of the electronic literature.&quot;, &quot; The game communities, then Porpentine posted to a collection of my work, and I&amp;#39;d seen from the visual editor so I contacted the highest individual numbers.&quot;, &quot; I looked at this as a fun experience some very difficult to demonstrate what I was experience some changes to their total count.&quot;, &quot; It&amp;#39;s enough to make a frame on the page that I added to the Twine GUI, so I offered they would probably comb through the code in the Twine GUI, so I posted a reply saying it had been, along with what was basically interesting.&quot;, &quot; One thing that I am not sure what they did was make a poet starting to die down, and this is what I learned that there in the 50-70 page range, and how many pages they read.&quot;, &quot; The piece in the process I started to experiencing he made some people are visiting which pages.&quot;, &quot; When I gave the file was loaded n times.&quot;, &quot; By this time the literary journal accounted for 0.&quot;, &quot;3n.&quot;, &quot; The rest were from that is my story was loaded 10n times.&quot;, &quot;

Early on in their browsers and interactive fictions called Twine when I had an idea for a piece that would be perfectly.&quot;, &quot; It was fun to watch people visit, watch the time people out in June.&quot;, &quot; Here&amp;#39;s review of the software, Chris Klimas, who was experiencing he made some people were from the gaming code that shows me in real time they stayed, and how many people were reading this piece.&quot;, &quot; The issue launch, or my piece in the issue, not to the issue, not to the journal sent out a week later, because I refuse to use Facebook numbers because it really seems like if I call a thing I did a poem people visit, watch people say that&amp;#39;s say that&amp;#39;s nice, dear and pat me on the head like I&amp;#39;m precious.&quot;, &quot; If I say I made a game I get READ.&quot;, &quot; Regards, Danay that&amp;#39;s 10,000 people in the two years that is my story was loaded n times.&quot;, &quot; By this time they stayed, and the author of the whole map, and write an introduction to it, and then put it behind a very small pay-wall.&quot;, &quot;

You ought to see her.&quot;, &quot; She&amp;#39;s —— began Miss Baker nodded.&quot;, &quot; I married him over a nonexistent nose.&quot;, &quot; Evidently some wild, strident argument which pass over a nonexistent nose.&quot;, &quot; Evidently some wild, strident argument which pulled me back into the room.&quot;, &quot; I almost made a mistake.&quot;, &quot; He borrowed somebody&amp;#39;s best suit to get away.&quot;, &quot; Doesn&amp;#39;t she lived with a girl friend at a sort of thing —— 10 Tom Buchanan compelled me forward breathlessly as some woman in my own instinct was the name of the lower orders.&quot;, &quot; They&amp;#39;ve been living over that garage must be a source of perpetual confusion to the glowing and singing.&quot;, &quot; I love to see you at my table, Nick.&quot;, &quot; You remind me of a — of a rose, an absolute rose.&quot;, &quot; Doesn&amp;#39;t her husband in a soft, coarse voice: Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to see her, I had no desire to meet her — but I did.&quot;, &quot; I went up together, for Mrs.&quot;, &quot; Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes fastened with an awed expression of unthoughtful sadness.&quot;, &quot; He reads deep books with privileged glimpses into the station he was out.&quot;, &quot; &amp;#39;oh, is that your suit?&amp;#39; I said when she sat down, glanced seaward — and an old Dodge and a little later the evening too would be over and casually conferred on my second glass of corky but rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.&quot;, &quot; Two shining secret society to which she accentuated by throwing her head up and down, at least you didn&amp;#39;t mean to, but —— Her voice again.&quot;, &quot; — And we&amp;#39;ve produced all the things hovering restlessly about the room, and the other hand I had nothing to do was to rush out of the world, the Middle West now seemed like that.&quot;, &quot; 27 Catherine leaned close to Tom&amp;#39;s, and faintly like a young cadet.&quot;, &quot; Her gray sun-strained the tournament to-morrow, explained Wilson quickly.&quot;, &quot; From Louisville.&quot;, &quot; Our white girlhood was passed together with an utterly abandoned grass roller in the diminished wind.&quot;, &quot; What kind? The man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from bad to worse, until finally said, &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m glad it&amp;#39;s all scientific, insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently around the country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the apartment.&quot;, &quot; Won&amp;#39;t you worry, he seemed to be alone — fifty feet away a figure on the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.&quot;, &quot; Is it a boy or a girl.&quot;, &quot; And I KNOW.&quot;, &quot; I&amp;#39;ve been trying to the white palaces of fashion that register earthquakes ten thousand a season.&quot;, &quot; the only car visible was that word hulking physical specimen of a —— 21 His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that much to read, for one thing, and some of the creative temperament.&quot;, &quot;— it was a colossal affair by any standard — it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic, he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.&quot;, &quot; Turning me by opening up to New York with Tom on the summer Sunday afternoon.&quot;, &quot; She really his wife, who felt just as George Wilson, nodding her at a table, 20 sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew.&quot;, &quot; Though I was curious to see her sister, too.&quot;, &quot; The man peered doubtfully into the station drug-store some cold cream and a small bedroom, and you are.&quot;, &quot; We backed up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the last minute the firm ordered him too, looking up and wondering.&quot;, &quot; I was crazy about him! cried Myrtle incredulously.&quot;, &quot; I almost made a mistake, too, she declared vigorously.&quot;, &quot; And that&amp;#39;s true.&quot;, &quot; She hesitated.&quot;, &quot; We heard footsteps on a stairs.&quot;, &quot; I want you to meet my girl.&quot;, &quot; Stay long? Of course you got that kind? There was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently there were no cigarettes, and I was him too, looking at her impatiently.&quot;, &quot; Things went from the mass of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored rug, making a short deft movements stood up into my face, promising to compel my attention, my belief, I felt that Tom would do for an introduction, won&amp;#39;t you.&quot;, &quot; Good night, said Daisy over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind died out about it.&quot;, &quot;&amp;#39; But I gave it to him any more crazy about him for a few days until he ran away — and an old Dodge and art, and all the time.&quot;, &quot; She looked at me with an old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.&quot;, &quot; Their house was even more elaborate afternoon, and when she gave no hint of it — indeed, I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler.&quot;, &quot; He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it began to affect his nose —— I have to leave you here.&quot;, &quot; I can&amp;#39;t seem to remember, but I think we talked for a year, and after various dela ferring to, but I wasn&amp;#39;t getting into a short deft movements stood up into the room.&quot;, &quot; I&amp;#39;m going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the well-rounded man.&quot;, &quot; This absorbing information about my neighbor&amp;#39;s lawn, and then drifted here and there&amp;#39;s a bird on the lawn suggested that town! The late afternoon sky bloomed with lingering regret, like children leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the train one afternoon, and Tom Buchanan and Mrs.&quot;, &quot; Wilson enthusiastically.&quot;, &quot; How much is it? That&amp;#39;s right, said Daisy.&quot;, &quot; What Gatsby? Before I could get the entry.&quot;, &quot; All I ask is that we&amp;#39;re descended from her, as I didn&amp;#39;t.&quot;, &quot; 28 Well, I married him because it didn&amp;#39;t make any sense to me.&quot;, &quot; Just as Tom and Myrtle after the firm ordered him to Washington, and I went over the telephone, but I didn&amp;#39;t know he&amp;#39;s a Catholic, and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the station he was trembling.&quot;, &quot; Involuntarily I glanced seaward — and distinguished nothing better to do.&quot;, &quot; I followed Tom inside.&quot;, &quot; The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only CRAZY I was was when I married him.&quot;, &quot; I knew right away I made a mistake.&quot;, &quot; He borrowed somebody&amp;#39;s best suit to get married to each other by our first names reappeared, made plans to go somewhere else after all.&quot;, &quot; It was a matter of chance that I should have sworn he was trembling.&quot;, &quot; Involuntarily I glanced impatiently around the groan of a picture of her, somewhere before.&quot;, &quot; You live down on Long Island Sound.&quot;, &quot; they are not perfect ovals — like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the apartment.&quot;, &quot; They&amp;#39;re nice to have dinner with thrilling voice.&quot;, &quot; It was the first sweetie she ever had.&quot;, &quot; He didn&amp;#39;t say any more, but we&amp;#39;ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that he had vanished, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.&quot;, &quot; In consequence, I&amp;#39;m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and whispered in my ear: Neither of them I call MONTAUK POINT— THE GULLS, and the other I call MONTAUK POINT— THE SEA.&quot;, &quot; The sister Catherine: Chester, he&amp;#39;d of got me sure.&quot;, &quot; Yes, but listen, a promise that she had said.&quot;, &quot; It made me the vicinity — except his wife, who moved close to Tom&amp;#39;s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life, as if her heart was trying to me: &amp;#39;Lucille, that man&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;way below you!&amp;#39; But if I hadn&amp;#39;t met Chester, I think he could make something, yawned Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest&amp;#39;s shrill metallic urgency out of mind.&quot;, &quot; To a certain temperament.&quot;, &quot;— it was a factual imitation of the old alignment gave a blurred rock.&quot;, &quot; Looked at us all radiantly.&quot;, &quot; Do you always watch for the longest day in the year.&quot;, &quot; She looked at me with an awed expression of unthoughtful sadness.&quot;, &quot; He reads deep books with long words in them.&quot;, &quot; What was that word hulking, objected Tom crossly, even in college I was unjustly accused of being rumored into marriage.&quot;, &quot; Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich — nevertheless, I was confused and a little dog was sitting on Tom&amp;#39;s lap Mrs.&quot;, &quot; Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little later the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.&quot;, &quot; Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been married to.&quot;, &quot; Myrtle considered.&quot;, &quot; I want you to meet her — but I doubt if even Miss Baker, honestly surprised.&quot;, &quot; I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.&quot;, &quot; 5 The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman, she said after a certain point I don&amp;#39;t know.&quot;, &quot; They had spent a year in France for no particular by this man Goddard? Why, no, I answered, rather surprised by his tone.&quot;, &quot; Well, I married him, said Mr.&quot;, &quot; McKee turned and continued on out the door.&quot;, &quot; When he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene — his wife, who moved close to Tom.&quot;, &quot; I want to see you, said Mr.&quot;, &quot; McKee turned around again, politely and abruptly.&quot;, &quot; We&amp;#39;ll go inside.&quot;, &quot; We walked through the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some woman? I repeated blankly.&quot;, &quot; 14 Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the war.&quot;, &quot; That&amp;#39;s true.&quot;, &quot; She laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived here.&quot;, &quot; But when I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions&quot;))(set: $text7 to (a: ...$text1) + (a: ...$text2) + (a: ...$text3) + (a: ...$text4) + (a: ...$text5) + (a: ...$text6))

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="About" tags="" position="378,431">It has always seemed to me that the process of writing stuff has consisted of four steps:

1) Experience life in all its infinite variety
2) Court serendipity and strange coincidence
3) Write that shit down
4) Search for dank lyrics in all the noise

This program seeks to automate those first three steps by producing a concrete block of interesting words. It does this by synthesizing the following sources:

- Ten Days in a Madhouse - Nellie Bly

- Susan McGrath on Polar Bears, National Geographic, January 2011 http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/07/polar-bears/mcgrath-text

- Truman Capote profile on Marlon Brando, The New Yorker, 1957

- Sharon Needles responds to David Bowie’s Death http://www.nylon.com/articles/sharon-needles-david-bowie-death

- A Story About A Story about Stories - Dan Weber by way of Cara Ellison and Porpentine https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/07/29/a-story-about-a-story-about-stories/#more-162111

- The Great Gatsby, chapters 2 and 1, chosen by dice-roll

These texts were chosen because I think they’re cool, and also they were easily findable online. The polar bears one and the David Bowie one were found  by googling “polar bears” and “sad david bowie tribute”. I chewed all the texts through a line break remover (www.textfixer.com/tools/remove-line-breaks.php) and a Markov chain generator (projects.haykranen.nl/markov/demo/) to render them into incomprehensible gobbledeygook. An HTML sanitizer was used to remove all problematic punctuation (defuse.ca/html-sanitize.htm). I then replaced every full stop in the text with the following weird glyph -&gt; .” “ which meant that I could paste them all into an array, with every &#x27;sentance&#x27; as a seperate entry. Then I wrote a little Twine program to spit out the sentences in random combinations. The idea is that you generate a ton of noise with interesting words in it and then read it through and look for any good phrases, shorn of their original contexts. These phrases ought to give you good ideas for stuff that you can write. Songs and poems and stuff. Whatever you&#x27;re into.

No texts are used with permission and I don’t know if copyright would apply after what I’ve done with them, but if you really want to send me a cease and desist or something I can be reached at ed@edsibley.co.uk
