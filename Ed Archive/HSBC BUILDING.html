&quot;Oh Diego!&quot; she cries. &quot;It is you!&quot;

[[&quot;What now?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="62" name="You get that frozen dude all pasted up." tags="" position="2644,2756">As the squid departs to swim amongst the stars and serve as prey for omniwhales, the frozen body of Diego Alvez seethes to life and stands beside its sometime companions. The beak of the squid descends upon a swell of aquatic radiance and the golem places this relic atop its haggard throat.

&quot;Mi corazon,&quot; it gurgles.

[[&quot;What now?&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="63" name="&quot;What now?&quot;" tags="" position="2552,2960">You are feeling pretty hopped-up. You and Audrey climb atop the shoulders of the golem, topping up its paste through the squid beak.

&quot;Alvez, my love, take us to your head,&quot; says Audrey. &quot;Take us to the Go-Go bar in Harajuku, so we can be reunited!&quot;

The golem roars and stamps its feet. It begins to run, its delicate hands tearing the walls that block its way. Soon it is above the sea, gliding atop a cloud of bees. From its beak comes a whistling sound.

The Go-Go bar comes in to view.

[[Enter Go-Go bar.]]
[[Coast the joint.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="64" name="&quot;I&#x27;ll kill you, you slaves!&quot;" tags="" position="2712,2440">The slaves are furious. A stampede echoes through the chamber. A blood-curdling scream erupts as they tear their chains and flood towards the chambers of their masters. Some of them run towards you!

Just then, Audrey shouts &quot;Catch!&quot; and throws you the paste.

[[Apply to Alvez&#x27;s truncated trachea.]]
[[Apply to slaves]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="65" name="&quot;You have nothing to lose but your chains!&quot;" tags="" position="2944,2412">The slaves rejoice. All around them, the world seems to shift into their possession and they are free. Some of them find a barrel of paste and apply it to their necks.

[[Get some paste yourself.|Apply to yourself.]]
[[Watch.|Apply to slaves]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="66" name="Apply to slaves" tags="" position="2852,2560">The slaves descend into a furious broil and in the ensuing tumult the entire room is coated in paste. A cacophony of cries fly in to the wind as the place is engulfed in a kind of madness - peculiar, but not unpleasant.

[[Some gets on the squid.|&quot;No, on the squid!&quot;]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="67" name="Enter Go-Go bar." tags="" position="2411,3153">On the walls of the Go-Go bar are black garments sorted according to the number of openings. The socks and hats have only one opening. The skirts have two openings. The trousers and pants have three, and the shirts and dresses have four. Someone is mixing up the displays.

The golem roars. &quot;Where is the head?&quot; Audrey shouts. &quot;Who owns this joint? I want to see who&#x27;s in charge. The manager.&quot;

The wall of the bar collapses. Atop a cybernetic body is the frozen head of Diego Alvez. &quot;I AM THE MANAGER!&quot; he cries.

&quot;My love, my sweet!&quot; cries Audrey. &quot;I&#x27;ve brought your body! We can be together once more, as it should always have been!&quot;

&quot;It is too late for us,&quot; says the head.

&quot;There is always time for love.&quot;

A single tear forms on the frozen head of Diego Alvez and freezes.

&quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;Now is the time for you to die.&quot;

[[&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;]]
[[&quot;Golem! Attack!&quot;]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="68" name="Coast the joint." tags="" position="2764,3144">On the roof of the bar is an ancient stone inscribed with the words &quot;This stone is the exclusive property of Harajuku Holdings Ltd.&quot; Audrey gasps. &quot;This stone is too beautiful for them to keep. I&#x27;m having it.&quot; She eats it. Audrey eats the stone. All of it.

There is a car park containing a caravan and some travellers. They are unimpressed by this display. They curse you.

You see nothing else.

[[Enter Go-Go bar.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="69" name="&quot;NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;" tags="" position="2284,3343">A swarm of anarcho-fashionistas enter the room elegantly as the mainframe monster orders the attack. The golem is quickly subdued by hands in well-fitting gloves. Audrey&#x27;s foul-smelling pouch of paste is torn from her grasp and she screams &quot;My money!&quot;

The frozen head of Diego Alvez says &quot;Now I will explain to you my master plan. I will form the greatest syndicate of wearable technology infrastructure consolidationists the world has ever known. Armed with my robot body and all your cash, I will consume the world.&quot;

&quot;Was I nothing to you, Diego?&quot;

&quot;Never more than the money, love. Megamarkets wait for no man, and you and I were borne together on a broken spar of antidemand that was destined only for insolvency. And now my scheme is complete. I will forever sever the old trite hierarchy of garments. No longer will clothes be shackled to phoney categories of tops and bottoms, and overclothes and underclothes. We dare to dream, here, of clothes that can be worn only on the right or left hand side of the body, or which grow to unfit the feeble supplicant frame upon which they are carried.&quot;

He begins to cackle and Audrey screams. Just then you notice something: There is a blob of scropaline paste, whatever it was called, who gives a shit, but you see some of this haute benzo paste on the paving stones and realise that with a deft slurp you could ingest it.

[[Ingest.]]
[[Use your tongue to flick it towards Audrey.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="70" name="&quot;Golem! Attack!&quot;" tags="" position="2654,3356">The golem and the cybernetic body are locked in mortal strife, each mighty humanoid throwing blows that would topple a lesser being. Neither gives an inch. A deadlock ensues. The titanic struggle overwhelms the sinews and breaks the spirits of both incarnations of Alvez. The body fights the self, and the self fights the body. The eyes of the frozen head are inches from the hooked tip of the squid beak, and the mighty paste-swollen flesh of the body seems fraught with a tension that is mirrored imperfectly by the latent hydraulic force of the cyberlimbs.

Just at that moment, Audrey appears behind the cybernetic form and wrenches the head from its spun-wire moorings. The squid beak opens and she drops the head in.

The room is filled with gentle light, and the beak and the empty shell of the robot drop away to the floor. Alvez looks down at Audrey and puts his arm around her waist. The sound seems to die in the room. He smiles and says &quot;Mi corazon.&quot;

GAME OVER</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="71" name="Ingest." tags="" position="2206,3549">The paste electrolyses your faculties and you zoomslope sideways out the orifice of the edifice while everyone watches this high-octane powerplay. You don&#x27;t much care to see how it turns out. This dame Audrey, she&#x27;s been using you from the get-go, for your wiles, and for your styles. You leave her to this severed-head situation. The head seemed like another one of these arseholes. They deserve each other.

You steal a skateboard, skitch on to the back of a passing freight train, and you are gone, over the horizon. The wake of your moto-dinghy disseminates on the waves of the South China Sea. No one ever sees you again.

GAME OVER</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="72" name="Use your tongue to flick it towards Audrey." tags="" position="2511,3546">As the corpuscle of goop arcs through the air, Audrey&#x27;s tongue protrudes from her lips in an effort to catch it. She fumbles the manoeuvre, however, and volleys the gob across the room. It lands between the eyes of the frozen head of Diego Alvez.

His robotic body turns red and assumes a life of its own, as is the paste is transmitted down the neurons of the frozen head of Diego Alvez into its titanium circuitry. It flips a table over and runs for the golem. The golem is destroyed. It then turns its attention to the frozen head, whose eyes have become black disks. The frozen head of Diego Alvez looks wonky as fuck and it fails to respond when the cybernetic body takes its corporeal revenge against the abstract intelligence that gave it life. It leaps in to the air, flattening the skull of Diego Alvez against a ceiling spar.

Audrey signals her security entourage. &quot;We&#x27;re done here,&quot; she says, and for only a moment you see what seems to be a flicker of uncertainty in her usual steely visage. &quot;Want to come back to the yacht?&quot;

[[Five years later.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="73" name="Five years later." tags="" position="2511,3696">Your baby is born. Audrey lies back in the hospital bed, smiling.

&quot;It&#x27;s a boy,&quot; she says, &quot;and I think we will name him... Diego.&quot;
