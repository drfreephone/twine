Henry&#39;s eyes open but he doesn&#39;t move to get out of bed.

&quot;This is unfamilliar. Is this... Lockehard? It must be. It&#39;s finally real. Here I am.&quot;

NB general note: I think this needs to be a bit more... strange? It would make for a more effective opening if there was something a bit off about the first conversation. It&#39;s what I was aiming for when she mentions devils all the time but it could work better.</tw-passagedata>

The room contains various things that can be examined - the bed, the window, the empty shelf, the airbrick.

{(click: &quot;window&quot;)[The workmen are up already. Looks like they&#39;re building some kind of conservatory out there. I wonder why they&#39;re putting it so far away from the rest of the mansion? ]

She pauses and looks at you.

&quot;You&#39;re not as tall as I&#39;d imagined. And I must say, in person you can&#39;t see the evidence of your deprivations as clearly as you could in the papers.&quot;

I understand you were making a fuss for the constables who were supervising you.&quot;]

(link: &quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;)[&quot;I&#39;m a humble member of the Presbyterian faith, and I live on the grounds with my husband, Mr. Foreman. He&#39;s the estate&#39;s blacksmith.&quot;]

(link: &quot;What sort of people are locked up here?&quot;)[&quot;Oh, you&#39;ll find out soon enough, don&#39;t you worry about that. Good people, all of them, but every one carries their burdens and is afflicted by the devils on their little wings.&quot;]

(link: &quot;Tell me about Mr. Lockehard.&quot;)[&quot;He&#39;s a very wise and very kind man. I believe his cause is just, although he is somewhat susceptable to the latest wild tomfooleries. His office contains a great many egyptological and mesmerical artifacts, which I do not think befits a Christian or should be present in a house so full of sensetive people. Still, he tries hard to look out for his charges, as a good shepherd should.&quot;]

(link:&quot;What are they building out there on the lawn?&quot;)[&quot;A home for crows and ravens. It is Mr. Lockehard&#39;s latest fancy that these abhorrent beasts might have a therapeutic property, and he intends to breed them. Foolishness, if you ask me.&quot;]</tw-passagedata>

If it wasn&#39;t so, why would the judge in his wisdom have sent you here? This is the path to your salvation, which will be achieved by rest, and frequent eating, and God&#39;s grace.&quot;

[[The Gospel of Fatness?|convo7]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="16" name="convo4" tags="" position="561,834">&quot;It&#39;s plain to see that your perverse actions in the past were caused by your mania. Here at Lockehard, we belive that deviant behaviour is caused by disturbance of the mind. We use modern treatments to bring calm to the disturbed individual, and in some cases cure them of their affliction.&quot;

[[There&#39;s nothing wrong with me.|convo5]]
[[Treatments?|convo6]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="17" name="convo7" tags="" position="676,1199">&quot;We follow a strict schedule at Lockehard, with seven meals throughout the day and a strict curfew. We rise at five o&#39;clock in the morning and retire at eight in the evening. The day is punctuated by frequent walks around the grounds, and plenty of time for recreation, dancing, music and so on. Rest and nourishment are the best tonics for the soul.&quot; *NB put some actual real info in here*
