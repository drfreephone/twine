-- THEY PROPOSE THE PLAN


-- THEN THERE&#39;S THREE &#39;LIKE, WE ALREADY KNOW X&#39; OPTIONS AND ONE &#39;GO GATHER SOME INTEL&#39; OPTION FOR IF YOU&#39;VE GOT NONE OF THE OPTIONS 
(WILL ALSO NEED EVENTUALITY FOR IF YOU HAVE ANIMUS AND ONE OF THE OTHERS)
(as well as eventuality for all possible combinations)


TASK FORCE MAIN HOTLINE:
--PROGRESS REPORT
--OPTIONS FOR EACH OF THE HANDINS
--REWARD INFORMANTS (SOME DUDE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU)
-- NEED A &#39;HANDED IN&#39; STORYSWITCH FOR EACH SO WE CAN INCREMENT THE COUNTER WHEN YOU CALL INTO THE TASK FORCE



-- adds the informant on a delay with each thing that&#39;s handed in
</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Untitled Passage 1" tags="" position="822,453">The hotline:

can check handed_in storyswitches versus informant storyswitches to see if you need informants

var dining_club = false;
var animus = false;
var hiding_out = false;
var something_new = false;

if (ds_map_exists(global.storyswitch, &quot;goraya_dining_club&quot;) &amp;&amp; !ds_map_exists(global.storyswitch, &quot;goraya_dining_club_recieved&quot;)) {dining_club = true}

if (ds_map_exists(global.storyswitch, &quot;goraya_animus&quot;) &amp;&amp; !ds_map_exists(global.storyswitch, &quot;goraya_animus_recieved&quot;)) {animus = true}

if (ds_map_exists(global.storyswitch, &quot;goraya_hiding_out&quot;) &amp;&amp; !ds_map_exists(global.storyswitch, &quot;goraya_hiding_out_recieved&quot;)) {hiding_out = true}


if dining_club || animus || hiding_out{
something_new = true
}

Do you have anything new?

if something_new then YES

else NO



on that yes screen: 

if animus then ____ (each of these assigns a storyswitch, which should recalculate the booleans because it runs the script again (and do a delayed event for an informer)
else if dining_club then ____
else if hiding_out then ____

after each page, do a &quot;Anything else?&quot; bit which checks something_new again (should be up to date if scr_call_storyswitch has been called)
Sends you back to that Yes screen if so
Or else gives you the &#39;nope, sorry&#39; option.

Then:

Some kind of status update thing, with some random content. Stuff like &#39;The photograph is already causing some hot debates.&#39;
Make sarcy joke about online discourse.

<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Untitled Passage 2" tags="" position="947,497">once two storyswitches are delivered, that person triggers the attack on miniFACT event (maybe there&#39;s a watcher object on the map?)

man, woman, old woman

recondite about being a narc
furtive at first

hatred of Goraya
I work in #industry (use new clue script)

never thought I&#39;d see the day when colluding with miniLAW would help the movement

sending useful ops records/safehouse locations/product manifests/protection reciepts
we keep this shit secret because we know how miniFACT operates
you can use your metadata telemetry

bad in the short term, but like chemo to burn out the cancer in the movement

goraya must go, that means I have to cooperate

minifact will bring you in and scrape everything you know
for the best in the long run
I know</tw-passagedata>
