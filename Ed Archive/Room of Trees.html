</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="Start" tags="" position="33,10">Notes: For the sake of experiment, I&#x27;m using a variable called FrustS to strack the survivor&#x27;s level of frustration with the player, and a variable called AlarmL to track Lux&#x27;s level of alarm at the player&#x27;s actions. Both start at 5.

The aim of the exercise is to work on branching dialogues and variable-tracking the character&#x27;s attitudes to the player.

If the player does something that antagonises or placates either character, these variables will change and so will their speech. Given that this is an experiment, I&#x27;ll mark on the dialogue options whether they have an effect or not so you can try different approaches. If Lux&#x27;s concern gets too high he might cut in and override the survivor, slowly losing his chill.

I don&#x27;t know how the room puzzle will work as I don&#x27;t really understand the detailed mechanics of the game so for the purposes of experiment, I&#x27;m handwaving all that.

At this stage in the game, it&#x27;s a real Lux but he&#x27;s pretending to be a prerecorded tour so as to be able to manipulate the player.

At this stage in the game, the player has yet to unlock the ability to communicate with the survivor in an uninhibited way so is still stuck on Yes, No, I Don&#x27;t Know.

Lux really cares about the trees.

The survivor would rather the trees went unharmed, but would prefer it if the player hurried up to get to the next room, where there&#x27;s something that matters to her.

Both of them have advised against coming here, but it seems like it&#x27;s the only way forward. The player is, by this time, well aware of the significance of this room.

It&#x27;s impossible to placate both.

The door to the Room of Trees opens ahead of you. You can see a row of small stumpy trees on either side of a central walkway. Up on the wall at the far end is the vent you&#x27;re trying to get into! But there&#x27;s no way up there and no obvious way to reach it. A sign on the wall conspicuously says &#x27;No Nanobots to be deployed in this fragile ecosystem&#x27;.

Lux cuts out.

The Survivor chimes in.
